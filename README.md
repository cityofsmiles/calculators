# calculators

A collection of calculators and solvers for high school Math teachers like me. 

## Installation 
To install the algebra solver, copy and paste each line to Termux: 

```
cd ~

pkg upgrade

pkg install -y wget

wget https://cityofsmiles.github.io/install-algeb-solver.sh

bash install-algeb-solver.sh
```

Wait for it to finish. Then type
```algeb```
and hit Enter. 

That's it!
